# Celestial Bodies Classification using CNN

This repository contains the code and resources for classifying celestial bodies (stars and galaxies) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The CNN model is trained on astronomical images to accurately distinguish between different types of celestial objects.

## Problem Statement

The classification of celestial bodies, such as stars and galaxies, plays a crucial role in astronomy and astrophysics. Manual classification methods are time-consuming and subjective, while traditional automated techniques may lack accuracy. Therefore, there is a need for an efficient and accurate automated classification system to classify celestial objects based on their images.

## Proposed Solution

The proposed solution involves developing a CNN-based classification model trained on a dataset of astronomical images. The CNN architecture is designed to extract relevant features from input images and classify them into different categories, such as stars and galaxies. Transfer learning techniques and data augmentation methods are employed to enhance the model's performance and robustness.

## End Users

The intended end users of this classification system include astronomers, researchers, and space agencies who require automated tools for analyzing large-scale astronomical datasets. Additionally, enthusiasts and students interested in astronomy can benefit from this system for educational purposes.

## System Development Approach

The system development approach involves the following steps:

1. **Data Acquisition**: Obtain a dataset of labeled astronomical images containing stars and galaxies.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Preprocess the images by resizing, normalization, and augmentation to enhance the diversity of the dataset.
3. **Model Development:** Design and train a CNN architecture for celestial body classification using TensorFlow/Keras.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Deployment:** Deploy the trained model as a web service or integrate it into existing astronomical data processing pipelines.
